# F# |> BABEL

### The compiler that emits JavaScript you can be proud of. [Try it out!](http://fsprojects.github.io/Fable/repl.html)
[![Mono Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fsprojects/Fable.svg "Mono Build Status")](https://travis-ci.org/fsprojects/Fable) [![.NET Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/vlmyxg64my74sik5?svg=true ".NET Build Status")](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/alfonsogarciacaro/fable)

Fable brings together the power of the [F# compiler](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Compiler.Service/)
and [Babel](http://babeljs.io) to make JavaScript a true backend for F#.
Some of its main features are:

- Works directly on F# source code, no compilation to .NET bytecode needed
- Optimizes F# code to generate as clean JavaScript as possible
- Passes location data to Babel to generate source maps
- Compatible with all Babel plugins and other JS development tools, like Webpack
- [Support for most of the F# core library and a bit of .NET Base Class Library](docs/compatibility.md)
- Tiny core library included (less than 10KB minified and gzipped) with no runtime
- Organizes code using ES6 modules 
- [Interacts seamlessly with other JavaScript libraries](docs/interacting.md)
- Bonus: [compile NUnit tests to Mocha](docs/testing.md)

## Philosophy

- **Clean code**: The compiler must emit JavaScript as readable as possible
  which plays well with other JS code and development tools, even if this
  means sacrificing a bit F# semantics. 
- **Unopinionated**: The project shouldn't compromise with a specific platform
  and adapt to standard JavaScript in any environment: browser or node.
- **Open to the community**: If the project is to survive, it needs the support of the community. For that, maintainers should compromise to keep the project documented and make it easy for people to contribute. A plugin system is also planned.

## Installing

The project is still in testing phase and hasn't been packaged yet. If you wan to try it out,
make sure you have [F# 4.0 with .NET/Mono](http://fsharp.org) and an updated version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.
Download the repo and run:
```
build.cmd   // on windows    
./build.sh  // on unix
```
If everything works, follow [these instructions](docs/compiling.md) to compile a F# project or script file to JS.

## Contributing

At the moment, the best way to contribute is to battle-test the project, report issues,
create samples and help promoting it. A [plugin system](docs/plugins.md) is also available
to allow you extend Fable according to you needs.

Issues with the label `discussion` will be also added to ask the opinion of the community
on different topics like the logo, roadmap, etc.

## Caveats

- **Options are erased** in compiled code. This has several benefits like removing overhead
  and interacting with native JS functions in a safer way (`null` will be `None`).
  However, it will lead to unexpected results if you do weird things like wrapping `null` in `Some`.
  For practical purposes, Fable considers `null`, `undefined`, `None` and `unit` to be the same thing.

- **Information about generic types is not included** in the generated JavaScript, so code that
  depends on this information to be known at runtime for method dispatching may have unexpected behaviour.

- At the moment, comparison for non-primitive values defaults to JS reference comparison so there's
  **no structural comparison** for records, unions, tuples or collections. This may change in the future
  upon users' feedback.

- **Map and Set** default to the new ES6 Map and Set classes which must increase performance,
  but with the downside that adding and removing operations are **mutable**.

- **Debugging the F# code is not perfect**. For example, you may see the debugger jump directly
  to the last expression in many functions. This is normal and due to the optimizations performed
  on the generated code.

## Acknowledgements

Of course, this project wouldn't have been possible without the fantastic work of the [F# compiler](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Compiler.Service/)
and [Babel](http://babeljs.io) teams. I hope they feel proud seeing how their work has met in
a very unexpected way, giving developers even more possibilities to build great apps.

The awesome F# community has played a big role in making this possible. I've met incredible
people and it's impossible to list all the names without forgetting anyone, but I'd like to
give a particular mention to [Zach Bray](https://github.com/ZachBray) for his work on [FunScript](http://funscript.info/), [Don Syme](https://github.com/dsyme) (the fact that the designer
of the language himself shows interest in your work, no matter how humble it is, is really a big push!)
and [Krzysztof Cie≈õlak](https://github.com/Krzysztof-Cieslak) (I always have to look up the name to spell it correctly) because he's shown that
F# is a perfect fit for a [big project targeting JS](http://ionide.io/).

And finally I'd like to thank my partner (is it too old-fashioned to say wife?) for bearing with me
everyday.
