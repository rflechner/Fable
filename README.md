### The compiler that emits JavaScript you can be proud of!

[![Mono Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fsprojects/Fable.svg "Mono Build Status")](https://travis-ci.org/fsprojects/Fable) [![.NET Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/vlmyxg64my74sik5?svg=true ".NET Build Status")](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/alfonsogarciacaro/fable) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/fable-compiler.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fable-compiler) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/fsprojects/Fable](https://badges.gitter.im/fsprojects/Fable.svg)](https://gitter.im/fsprojects/Fable?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)


Fable brings together the power of the [F# compiler](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Compiler.Service/)
and [Babel](http://babeljs.io) to make JavaScript a true backend for F#.
Some of its main features are:

- Works directly on F# source code, no compilation to .NET bytecode needed
- Optimizes F# code to generate as clean JavaScript as possible
- Passes location data to Babel to generate source maps
- Compatible with all Babel plugins and other JS development tools, like [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io)
- Support for most of the [F# core library](http://fsprojects.github.io/Fable/docs/compatibility.html) and a bit of .NET Base Class Library
- Tiny core library included (less than 10KB minified and gzipped) with no runtime
- Organizes code using ES6 modules
- Interacts seamlessly with other [JavaScript libraries](http://fsprojects.github.io/Fable/docs/interacting.html)
- Bonus: compile [NUnit tests to Mocha](http://fsprojects.github.io/Fable/docs/compiling.html#Testing)

## Usage

A beta version has been released to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fable-compiler)! You can install and run it just by typing:

```shell
npm install -g fable-compiler
fable path/to/your/project.fsproj
```

> Note the package name is `fable-compiler` while the command is just `fable`

> You must have [F# 4](http://fsharp.org) and [node 4.4](https://nodejs.org/en/) or higher installed in your computer.

You can find more detailed instruction about F# to JS compilation in the [docs](http://fsprojects.github.io/Fable/docs/compiling.html).
Also you can have a look at the [samples](http://fsprojects.github.io/Fable/samples.html) or download them from [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/alfonsogarciacaro/fable/artifacts/samples.zip).

## Contributing

At the moment, the best way to contribute is to battle-test the project, report issues,
create samples and help promoting it. A [plugin system](http://fsprojects.github.io/Fable/docs/plugins.html) is also available
to allow you extend Fable according to you needs.

Issues with the label `discussion` will be also added to ask the opinion of the community
on different topics like the logo, roadmap, etc.

## Caveats

- **Options are erased** in compiled code. This has several benefits like removing overhead
  and interacting with native JS functions in a safer way (`null` will be `None`).
  However, it will lead to unexpected results if you do weird things like wrapping `null` in `Some`.
  For practical purposes, Fable considers `null`, `undefined`, `None` and `unit` to be the same thing.

- **Information about generic types is not included** in the generated JavaScript, so code that
  depends on this information to be known at runtime for method dispatching may have unexpected behaviour.

- **Debugging the F# code is not perfect**. For example, you may see the debugger jump directly
  to the last expression in many functions. This is normal and due to the optimizations performed
  on the generated JS code.

## Acknowledgements

Of course, this project wouldn't have been possible without the fantastic work of the [F# compiler](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Compiler.Service/)
and [Babel](http://babeljs.io) teams. I hope they feel proud seeing how their work has met in
a very unexpected way, giving developers even more possibilities to build great apps.

The awesome F# community has played a big role in making this possible. I've met incredible
people and it's impossible to list all the names without forgetting anyone, but I'd like to
give a particular mention to [Zach Bray](https://github.com/ZachBray) for his work on [FunScript](http://funscript.info/), [Don Syme](https://github.com/dsyme) (the fact that the designer
of the language himself shows interest in your work, no matter how humble it is, is really a big push!)
and [Krzysztof Cie≈õlak](https://github.com/Krzysztof-Cieslak) (I always have to look up the name to spell it correctly) because he's shown that
F# is a perfect fit for a [big project targeting JS](http://ionide.io/).

And finally I'd like to thank my partner (is it too old-fashioned to say wife?) for bearing with me
everyday.
