### [<i class="fa fa-bank" aria-hidden="true"></i> Fable architecture](docs/plugins.html)

Is it very easy to add features to Fable using plugins. The best example is [the
plugin to transform NUnit tests into Mocha](https://github.com/fsprojects/Fable/tree/master/src/plugins/Fable.Plugins.NUnit.fsx).
In order to understand the plugin system we'll review briefly how Fable works.
